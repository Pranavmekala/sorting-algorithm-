# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** created using [your tech stack, e.g., Python and Pygame]. It provides an interactive and educational way to visualize how various sorting algorithms work by animating the process step by step.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the sorting process unfold dynamically.
- **Interactive Interface**: Customize parameters like array size and animation speed.

## Algorithms Supported

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- [Any other dependencies, e.g., Pygame library]
